- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jvd-malek
  
As an experienced Full-Stack Developer, I excel at designing and developing robust web applications across various industries.   

In the front-end, I utilize cutting-edge technologies such as React.js, Redux, and TypeScript, while leveraging Tailwind CSS for beautiful and user-friendly designs. On the backend, I work with either Express.js or Django to build APIs, and leverage SQL Server and MongoDB for data management.  

With several years of hands-on experience, I have a proven track record of successfully implementing diverse and challenging projects. I am a lifelong learner, always seeking to enhance my skills, and I thrive in dynamic collaborative environments. I am continuously looking for opportunities that allow me to further develop my technical expertise.
