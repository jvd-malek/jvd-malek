- 👋 Hi, I’m @jvd-malek
  
As a Front-End Developer, I excel at designing and developing robust web applications across various industries.

In the front-end, I utilize cutting-edge technologies such as React.js, Redux, and TypeScript, while leveraging Tailwind CSS for beautiful and user-friendly designs. 

I also work with back-end technologies such as Express.js and Graphql to build APIs, and leverage SQL Server and MongoDB for data management.

With two years of hands-on experience, I have a proven track record of successfully implementing diverse and challenging projects. I am a lifelong learner, always seeking to enhance my skills, and I thrive in dynamic collaborative environments. I am continuously looking for opportunities that allow me to further develop my technical expertise.
